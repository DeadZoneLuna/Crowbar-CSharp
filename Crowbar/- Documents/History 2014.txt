History 2014



[01-Feb-2014]
/ Implement 12 possible ways to convert quaternion to euler angles.



[02-Feb-2014]
/ Fix reading-in and writing-out of "anim+bone" data.



[03-Feb-2014]
/ Find right conversion to use out of the 12 possible ways to convert quaternion to euler angles.



[04-Feb-2014]
- Fix use of $concave for the collision mesh of L4D2's van.mdl.



[09-Feb-2014]
/ Based on a bug report from atrblizzard decompiling a VTM:B model, I changed some lines in SourceQcFile.
	Changed from:
		Me.WriteHboxRelatedCommands()
	To:
		If theSourceEngineModel.theMdlFileHeader.theHitboxSets IsNot Nothing Then
			Me.WriteHboxRelatedCommands()
		End If



[11-Feb-2014]
/ Fix use of $concave for the collision mesh of L4D2's van.mdl.


[12-Feb-2014]
/ BUG: QC file $texturegroup does not list the texture file names correctly for TF2's "models\weapons\v_models\v_medigun_medic.mdl"
/ BUG: Static prop ref meshes are not rotated correctly.
/ Tweaked the $animation and $sequence lines in the qc file.



[13-Feb-2014]
/ IDEA: Comment-out $cbox qc line, and indicate it is unlikely used.
/ IDEA: If $hbox is automatically generated, comment-out the $hbox lines.
/ Fix up the name used for ref and lod mesh smd file name. 
	* Sometimes, a file name has redundant name within it, such as "van_van.smd" and "van_van_lod1.smd".
X Change from using "*_hlmv.qc" to using "*_hlmv.crowbarqc".
	* The compiler always changes the extension to qc.
/ Fix the qc lines of the blended sequences and animations.
	/ Commented-out subtract, addlayer, and delta for both $animation and $sequence.

=== Crowbar 0.14
========================================



[14-Feb-2014]

/ Use default value for "DecompileFolderName" of: "decompiled" + the Crowbar version number.
/ DEV: Add "DecompileMdlPathFileName" to AppSettings.
/ Change name of tabs to nouns, such as "Decompiler" and "Compiler".
/ IDEA: Move the Decompile Log to its own tab page, along with related widgets.

/ BUG: Tab order (tabbing between widgets) is messed up.
- BUG: Right-click a QC file and choose "open with > Crowbar", It opens it in the DECOMPILE tab, in the MDL file bar.
	* It should open in the Compile tab.
- IDEA: Error report should have the following info:
	- mdl or qc file name, depending on decompiling or compiling
	- paths used in the decompile or compile

=== Crowbar 0.15
========================================



[19-Feb-2014]
/ BUG: 0.15 added 8 bytes to read in for version 49 mdl files, but that breaks some L4D2 version 49 models.
	SOLUTION: Analyze offsets to determine when the extra bytes are used and adjust accordingly.
/ BUG: "Cancel Decompile" button is not enabled during decompiling.
/ BUG: Right-click a QC file and choose "open with > Crowbar", It opens it in the DECOMPILE tab, in the MDL file bar.
	* It should open in the Compile tab.
- IDEA: Use radio buttons for the two options of giving the folder to put decompiled files.
- IDEA: Use checkboxes for different types of files to decompile.
	- Default to having all boxes checked.
	* Example:
		- QC file
			- Include extra info as comments
		- Reference mesh SMD file
			- Apply the L4D2 survivor "right-hand fix"
		- Collision mesh SMD file
		- Animation VTA file (face flexes)
		- Animation SMD files
			- Include debug info
		- Procedural bones VRD file
		- Debug info files

	TO: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SourceFilmmaker\game\usermod\gameinfo.txt
/ Fixed some syntax with decompile log.
/ BUG: Decompile log showed checking of extra files when decompiling an animation-only mdl.
	* SOLUTION: Move code to determine "if animation-only mdl" from SourceMdlFile.ReadFileHeader() to SourceMdlFile.ReadMdlHeader01().
/ BUG: [01-Mar-2014 6000 ANGRY BEES] "Dark Messiah of Might and Magic" npc_leanna.mdl not decompiling all files.
	* CAUSE: Aniamtions with SourceMdlAnimationDesc.STUDIO_ALLZEROS flag are not handled correctly.
/ BUG: Dota 2 models don't decompile with texture paths, so the $cdmaterials lines are missing from the qc file.



[02-Mar-2014]
- Decompile mdl version 10 models.



[03-Mar-2014]
/ BUG: When phy checksum does not match mdl checksum, the physics commands are not written to qc file.
	/ Write out the commands, leaving the comment about mismatched checksums.
- Decompile ANI file.



[04-Mar-2014]
- Decompile ANI file.

[11-Mar-2014]
/ batch decompiling -- on error, jump to the next mdl in the list
	SOLUTION: Wrap code in Decompiler.DecompileOneModel() with "try".
/ batch compiling -- on error, jump to the next qc in the list
	SOLUTION: Wrap code in Compiler.CompileOneModel() with "try".
/ "Skip current model decompile" button for batch decompiling.



[12-Mar-2014]
/ Redo Decompile Output Folder Full Path browse window to use file browse window 
	for selecting a folder. Do in similar way as WinMerge.
	* The folder browse window is awkward and the file browse window is better.

=== Crowbar 0.21
========================================



[17-Apr-2014]
/ In Compiler tab, change the button text 
	From: "Compile to Different Subfolder:"
	To  : "Compile to different subfolder (of "models" folder):"
/ In Compiler tab, change the custom output folder 
	From: custom
	To  : for_model_viewer



[19-Apr-2014]
/ BUG: Reported that Decompile buttons were not showing at bottom of window. 
	* The screenshot seems to indicate that Windows is not resizing the widgets properly. Unknown why.
	* After some searching, saw something about using a Panel with "Dock = Fill" setting inside a UserControl, 
		to make widgets inside UserControl use their Anchor property correctly.
	* Also saw this article about Windows non-default text sizes causing the same visual problem:
		http://blog.davidegrayson.com/2013/04/unusable-ui-caused-by-windows-forms.html
	SOLUTION: Inserted a Panel (with "Dock = Fill" setting) in all UserControls, 
		placing all widgets of the UserControl inside the Panel.

	Change in SourceMdlFile.ReadMdlAnimation()...
		FROM:
			boneIndex = Me.theInputFileReader.ReadByte()
			If boneIndex = 255 Then
				Continue For

		TO:
			boneIndex = Me.theInputFileReader.ReadByte()
			If boneIndex = 255 Then
				Me.theInputFileReader.ReadByte()
				Me.theInputFileReader.ReadInt16()
				Continue For
			End If



[15-Jul-2014]
/ Change default Counter-Strike Global Offensive CompilerPathFileName
	FROM: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer\bin\studiomdl.exe
	TO: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\bin\studiomdl.exe
/ For models decompiled from CSGO, added in roll, pitch, yaw values to end of $hbox QC command.
	* NOTE that Valve did not change model version number of CSGO model even though version 49 models for other games do NOT compile with the extra roll, pitch, yaw values.
		Crowbar handles this by adding the extra values only when model version >= 49 and the $hboxset is "cstrike".
- Need to test the change to $hbox on various models in CSGO and other games.



[04-Aug-2014]
- Add in $animblocksize QC command.
